# Module 1 Overview: Course Overview & Computational Foundations

This first module sets the foundation for how we will approach
computational mechanics throughout the semester.

Although many students may have seen some of these tools before, this
module ensures that everyone begins the course with a shared
understanding of the workflow, expectations, and computational mindset
we will use going forward.
