## Module 2 Overview  
**Module 2: Nonlinear Systems and Continuum Foundations**

In Module 1, we introduced Taylor series expansions as the mathematical tool
used to approximate nonlinear functions by linear ones. In this module, we
build directly on that idea by examining how nonlinear systems are actually
solved.

This module focuses on **Newton’s method** for systems of nonlinear equations.
Newton’s method is not simply a root-finding algorithm; it is the fundamental
mechanism by which nonlinear engineering problems are repeatedly linearized and
solved. Each Newton iteration requires the solution of a linear system involving
the Jacobian (or tangent) operator, making nonlinear solution strategies central
to computational mechanics, finite element analysis, and multiphysics
simulations.
